## (❤ω❤) KaomojiDB (❤ω❤)

Have you ever had that issue where you want to express your feelings in an online comment section, but the emojis you always use feel boring?

# Kaomoji is here to help! (^ω^)

But even then finding the right one is a time-consuming task filled with visits to sketchy sites with AI-generated ads (>';..;')>

That's why I am currently developing:

# KAOMOJIDB ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ

This lightweight, local, and easy to use program saves a database of Kaomoji that you can search through at a moment's notice, without having to search on the internet.

This database is fully customizable! Search by the mood you want to convey, give each kaomoji a name, and freely edit, add, and delete anything in the database!

# It's your own Kaomoji dictionary (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

## How to use KaomojiDB
